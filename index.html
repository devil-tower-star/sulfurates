  <p><b>Sulfur</b><br>
    Sulfur's atomic number is 16 and it's atomic mass is 32. It has 16 protons, 16 neutrons and 16 electrons. The purpose of this model was to portray subatomic particles (protons, neutrons and electrons) and the particles that make up those (quarks and gluons). For this reason, the model does not cover valence and core electrons. It also does not completely cover sub-orbitals, which will be explained below. This model is better than a Bohr model for demonstrating the different subatomic particles but a Bohr model would be better suited for differentiating between core and valence electrons for the sake of clarity. Valence electrons are also touched on in the sulfate model.
  </p>
  <p><b>Sulfate</b><br> 
  Sulfate is comprised of one sulfur atom and four oxygen atoms. It has a charge of -2 so it has 32 valence electrons in total and 2 single bonds and 2 double bonds. Oxygen with one bond has three lone pairs and a negative charge, oxygen with two bonds has two lone pairs and a neutral charge. The model however, does not depict this and instead shows oxygen with 6 valence electrons. This may come off as confusing to viewers because the Octet rule states that an atom tends to lose or gain electrons to reach 8 valence electrons, while the oxygen atoms in this model appear to have more. This is because the model is meant to simultaneously display the bonds and valence electrons, so when compared to a Lewis Dot structure, it does a better job showing the total valence electrons separately from the bonds instead of together. The atoms were also intentionally color coded to show what type of atom is was and how it bonded with the rest of the compound. So while the number of valence electrons appears to be inaccurate, this does not detract from the overall model, which shows how sulfur and oxygen atoms (and their valence electrons) come together to form sulfate. This also is why smaller details, such as the subatomic particles are omitted.
  </p>
  <p><b>I-5 and the Environment</b><br> 
   Sulfur and sulfate are linked, where sulfate is a product emitted from fuels with sulfur. It is also found in electric car batteries. Sulfur is a natural component of crude oil and is released from burning fossil fuels and fuel spills. That means both of these would be found on streets and highways like I-5, given that they are components and byproducts of vehicles. However, sulfur and sulfates have also made their way into the rest of the environment, with large amounts found in the air and water. While trace amounts of sulfur and sulfate are beneficial for plants, there is an excess of it currently and ends up harming not only plants but humans and animals as well. Sulfate also exists in such large quantities in the air that it scatters light. Both cause heavily impaired breathing and acid rain and short-term exposure can cause other health issues. 
   <br>Homeless people and people who do construction work on roads are greatly at risk because they may spend a lot of time being exposed to chemicals on or near freeways without adequate protection against them. People who live nearby or commute a lot may also be at risk for the same reason.
  <br>There is also a surprising lack of information on not only sulfur and sulfate, but other dangerous compounds, with many precise reports on them being outdated. This is a serious issue and the fact that people know so little may mean that companies that profit off of these chemicals do not want people knowing what exactly they are being exposed to.
  </p>
  <p><b>Modeling Merits and Limitations</b><br>
      Clarity was prioritized in both models. Bohr models also only depict energy levels and electrons, where Lewis Dot models depict valence electrons and bonds between elements. It's important to identify the aspects presented by each type of model when evaluating what kind of model would most properly represent a compound or element. Different aspects of the element and compound models are included depending on what information needed to be provided at the given level. For example, the sulfur model shows energy levels, the nucleus, and quarks because that's what's important when observing elements individually. On the other hand, it's important to identify bonds, valence electrons and how they are paired up so that was included in the sulfate model. When compared to a Bohr or Lewis Dot model, these two models include more than just energy levels or bonds, but still reference them in order to combine different facets of the models. This means that some information is left out of each, but the more important aspects were emphasized. This ends up being beneficial due to the model being less crowded and clear to interpret. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Representing Sub-orbitals</b><br>
  Sub-orbitals are the areas in which electrons are most likely to be found. And apparently nobody knows exactly how they look in relation to the nucleus of an element, which made trying to model them a little difficult as they are entirely different from the Bohr model. I eventually gave up and attempted to portray the electrons that would belong to different sub-orbitals (s represented as cyan and p represented as green) as seen with the Aufbau Principle. However, the sulfur model still fails to accurately represent sub-orbitals, but the color-coded electrons are a lot less confusing than the actual shapes that sub-orbitals take. However, below is an image of my theory as to how sub-orbitals might be modeled.</p>

<!-- valid for showing subatomic particles but not core and valence electron tell purpose of each model tell merits and what was left out and why it is a good model to observe CERTAIN THINGS but not others and expain why that makes it better than a lewis dot or bohr--!>
