  <p><b>Sulfur</b><br>
    Sulfur's atomic number is 16 and it's atomic mass is 32. It has 16 protons, 16 neutrons and 16 electrons.
  </p>
  <p><b>Sulfate</b><br> 
  Sulfate is comprised of one sulfur atom and four oxygen atoms. It has a charge of -2 so it has 32 valence electrons in total and 2 single bonds and 2 double bonds.
  </p>
  <p><b>I-5 and the Environment</b><br> 
   Sulfur and sulfate are linked, where sulfate is a product emitted from fuels with sulfur. It is also found in electric car batteries. Sulfur is a natural component of crude oil and is released from burning fossil fuels and fuel spills. That means both of these would be found on streets and highways like I-5, given that they are components and byproducts of vehicles. However, sulfur and sulfates have also made their way into the rest of the environment, with large amounts found in the air and water. While trace amounts of sulfur and sulfate are beneficial for plants, there is an excess of it currently and ends up harming not only plants but humans and animals as well. Sulfate also exists in such large quantities in the air that it scatters light. Both cause heavily impaired breathing and acid rain and short-term exposure can cause other health issues. 
   <br>Homeless people and people who do construction work on roads are greatly at risk because they may spend a lot of time being exposed to chemicals on or near freeways without adequate protection against them. People who liv nearby or commute a lot may also be at risk for the same reason.
  <br>There is also a surprising lack of information on not only sulfur and sulfate, but other dangerous compounds, with many precise reports on them being outdated. This is a serious issue and the fact that people know so little may mean that companies that profit off of these chemicals do not want people knowing what exactly they are being exposed to.
  </p>
  <p><b>Model Limitations</b><br>
  Different aspects of the element and compound models are included depending on what information needed to be provided at the given level. For example, the sulfur model shows energy levels, the nucleus, and quarks because that's what's important when observing elements individually. On the other hand, it's important to identify bonds, valence electrons and how they are paired up so that was included. This means that some information is left out of each, but the more important aspects were emphasized.</p>
  <p><b>Representing Suborbitals</b><br>
  Suborbital are the areas in which electrons are most likely to be found. And apparently nobody knows exactly how they look in relation to the nucleus of an element, which made trying to model them a little difficult as they are entirely different from the Bohr model. I eventually gave up and attempted to portray the electrons that would belong to different suborbitals (s represented as cyan and p represented as green) as seen with the Aufbau Principle. However, below is an image of my theory as to how suborbitals might be modeled.</p>
