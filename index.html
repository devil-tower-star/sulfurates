  <p><b>Model Limitations</b><br>
  Different aspects of the element and compound models are included depending on what information needed to be provided at the given level. For example, the sulfur model shows energy levels, the nucleus, and quarks because that's what's important when observing elements individually. On the other hand, it's important to identify bonds, valence electrons and how they are paired up so that was included. This means that some information is left out of each, but the more important aspects were emphasized.</p>
  <p><b>Representing Suborbitals</b><br>
  Suborbital are the areas in which electrons are most likely to be found. And apparently nobody knows exactly how they look in relation to the nucleus of an element, which made trying to model them a little difficult as they are entirely different from the Bohr model. I eventually gave up and attempted to portray the electrons that would belong to different suborbitals (s represented as cyan and p represented as green) as seen with the Aufbau Principle. However, below is an image of my theory as to how suborbitals might be modeled.</p>
