  <p>Note: Models are low quality because they're being animated but you can zoom in and move around to see things more clearly. This was a pain in the ass</p>

  <br><br><p>Model Limitations <br>
  Different aspects of the element and compound models are included depending on what information needed to be provided at the given level. For example, the sulfur model shows energy levels, the nucleus, and quarks because that's what's important when observing elements individually. On the other hand, it's important to identify bonds, valence electrons and how they are paired up so that was included. This means that some information is left out of each, but the more important aspects were emphasized. WIP</p>
